# What is pair programming? 🤝

## Pairing

> Two things, people, or organizations that work together.

Pairing essentially refers to two people getting together to reach a common goal.

## Pair programming

> Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation.

Pair programming consists of two engineers sharing a computer to reach a common goal. There are different techniques used but the most common ones are the following:

- Driver/navigator: The driver types the code, the navigator thinks ahead.
- Ping pong: Dev 1 writes a failing test, dev 2 makes it pass, dev 2 writes a failing test, dev 1 makes it pass, repeat.

## Remote pair programming

Remote pair programming is an extension of pair programming where two engineers share a single workstation remotely to reach a common goal. It's a practice which is growing since working remotely is almost inevitable in 2020.

# The myths of pair programming 🤥

Even if this practice is well known in the industry, there are a few myths which stop people and companies from giving it a chance.

## Slow

> Two engineers working together is slower than two engineers working separately. They produce less code.

Engineers are not hired and should not be measured on their code output. Instead, the quality of an engineer resides in their ability to solve problems, communicate and create solutions. Putting two engineers together means more brain power hence higher code quality, stronger problem solving, clearer solutions, faster development.

## Only works when onboarding new developers

## Not a good fit for me

Pair programming might not be a good fit for everyone, it is however, in my opinion, not to be discarded before trying.

Junior developers might be reluctant to pair programming as it exposes their skills to the rest of the team.

Some engineers will argue that they work better and are more efficient when alone so pair programming is not a useful practice. However, this argument goes against the most important skills of an engineer working in a team: empathy, team player, eagerness to learn and leadership. This shows that the core of the problem is not pair programming but the engineer as they should not be working in a team.

# Why you should give it a try 👷🏻‍♂️

## Knowledge sharing & team spirit

Both as a new developer and as an experienced one, there are so much opportunity for leaning when it comes to pair programming.

- As a new player, there is so much you can learn from more experienced engineers through pair programming. Think about it like a mentor and an apprentice, it's leaning by doing, learn about how to use a technology, learn how to use tools, shortcuts, debugging techniques, etc. All those things would take much longer for someone to figure them out by themselves.

- As a experienced engineer -> question habits, new skill, understand complex concept by explaining them, train your team

## Speed & continuous code review

Pair programming eliminates a lot of discussions during the pull requests review process by moving those during the development phase. In a pair, there is always one engineer responsible for coding, the other one for thinking ahead. By having this separation of concern, more thinking power goes into identifying issues, finding optimal solutions, avoiding common pitfalls as opposed when coding alone where one has to divide their thinking power between coding and ???.

# How to get started 🛠

## Ask and experiment

Pair programming does not have to be a big deal. You do not have to explicitly schedule an official pair programming session with someone. Instead, just ask them to look at some code with you! Then you can pair program if needed and it'll feel more natural, more relaxed, more comfortable and people will be willing to do it more often!

It might not be relevant for you and your team to pair on every issues. Experiment with the frequency of the sessions, the length of the sessions,

## Use the right tools

If pairing on site make sure to use:

- Two keyboards
- Two monitors
- Two mice

all connected to one computer. With this setup, REASON ???

If pairing remotely, there are different apps you can use:

- [Tuple](https://tuple.app/) (personal favorite)
- [screen](https://screen.so)
- [TeamViewer](https://www.teamviewer.com/en-us/)
- [use-together](https://www.use-together.com/)

## Practice

Pair-programming is a skill. Being good at pair-programming takes practice. Here are a few points to keep in mind while pairing:

- Pair with empathy
- Reduce ceremony
- Take breaks
- Do a mini retrospective after each session
