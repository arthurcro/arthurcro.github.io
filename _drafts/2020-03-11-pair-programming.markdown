# What is pair programming? 🤝

## Pairing

> Two things, people, or organizations that work together.

Pairing essentially refers to two people getting together to reach a common goal.

## Pair programming

> Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation.

Pair programming consists of two programmers sharing a computer to reach a common goal. There are different techniques used but the most common ones are the following:

- Driver/navigator: The driver types the code, the navigator thinks ahead.
- Ping pong: Dev 1 writes a failing test, dev 2 makes it pass, dev 2 writes a failing test, dev 1 makes it pass, repeat.

## Remote pair programming

Remote pair programming is an extension of pair programming where two programmers share a single workstation remotely to reach a common goal. It's a practice which is growing among developers since working remotely is almost inevitable in 2020.

# The myths of pair programming 🤥

Even if this practice is well known in the industry, there are a few myths that usually stop people and companies from giving it a chance.

## Slow

> Two engineers working together is slower than two engineers working separately.

Engineers are not hired and should not be measured on their code output. Instead, the quality of an engineer resides in their ability to ???. Putting two engineers together means more brain power hence higher code quality, higher "thinking", faster development.

## Only works when onboarding new developers

## Not a good fit for me

- Never tried, afraid of experimenting and leaving the comfort zones
- Insecure of their skills
- "Bette alone" -> Lack of skills A, B, C, empathy team player,

# Why you should give it a try 👷🏻‍♂️

## Learning

Both as a new developer and as an experienced one, there are so much opportunity for leaning when it comes to pair programming.

## Speed

## Continuous code review

# How to get started 🛠

## Ask and experiment

## Use the right tools
