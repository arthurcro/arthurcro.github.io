## Getting to know a codebase

I newly joined a team on a project that has been live for a few years already. For that reason, I had to get to know my way around a pretty complex and big codebase in a short amount of time. 

It's always very time consuming to figure out which class is responsible for what, what subclass of `UIViewController` is displayed, etc. It can be overwhelming and we don't always have the tools or techniques to explore a codebase without constantly bothering our team members. 

I would like to share a few tips that allowed me to efficiently get familiar with a new codebase in a short amount of time! 

### Symbolic breakpoint üßê

Symbolic breakpoint allows setting a breakpoint based on a symbol like a method or function name, regardless of where that name might appear in the code.

With that in mind, we can use a symbolic breakpoint to print out the name of a subclass of `UIViewController` every time it triggers `viewDidAppear`. This allows us to know which `UIViewController` is currently displayed. 

- Go to the **Breakpoint Navigator**
- Select the **+** symbol at the bottom of the screen
- Choose **Symbolic breakpoint...**
- Add the following: 

![]({{site.baseUrl}}/assets/symbolic_breakpoint.png)

### Call stack üìö

While your app is running, it stores information about what it's dong in a call stack. You can view that call stack in the **Debug Navigator** by stopping your app with a breakpoint. 

![]({{site.baseUrl}}/assets/call_stack.png)

This allows you to check the behavior of a method and how it interacts with other parts of your app. For example, you might want to figure out why and where a specific method was called. 

Alternatively, you can also use a breakpoint action that will print out the call stack without pausing the app.

### Debug view hierarchy üîç

In most projects, you will find subclasses of `UIView`, `UICollectionViewCell`, `UIViewController` and many more. While exploring a big codebase, it's not always easy to figure out where, when and how those subclasses are being used. One thing that really helped me is the **Debug View Hierarchy** in Xcode.

To use it, while your app is running, click on ![]({{site.baseUrl}}/assets/debug_view_hierarchy_button.png).
Xcode will open the **Debug View Hierarchy** like so:

![]({{site.baseUrl}}/assets/debug_view_hierarchy.png)

and you will be able to easily identify subclasses and inspect the navigation stack of your app. 

### Shortcuts üöÄ

There are a few shortcuts built-in Xcode that are very useful to explore a codebase.

`Cmd + click` on a symbol will open a menu with different options. 

![]({{site.baseUrl}}/assets/cmd_click_popup.png)

- **Jump to definition** will jump to the source or header of the selected symbol.

- **Callers** will show you all the files where that symbol is used.


 Also, you can use `Cmd + Shift + j`  from any file to reveal it in the **Project Navigator**.
